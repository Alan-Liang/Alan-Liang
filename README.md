### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Alan-Liang/Alan-Liang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ATTAPL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to drive.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Free Software.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with choosing my next laptop. (My current choice is Lenovo ThinkBook 16p.)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: look for my contact information in GitHub!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/she/it/<img src onerror=alert(/xss/)>
- âš¡ Fun fact: not an OIer.

My real name: run the command below (replace MY_NAME_HERE with my real name)
echo -n 'MY_NAME_HERE is the name of https://github.com/Alan-Liang' | sha256sum
if you get `c6fa36cf7f433c642d4d9403e0f2e87f0da9da06386e241fbb185d2a69904ae6` - it's really my name!
